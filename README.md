# Purpose of this repository

This repository contains a list of scripts and config files that I wrote for my own use.

I upload it here first to easily find whenever I will need them again, but also in the hope they can be useful to someone else

# Scripts

   * _no_ip.sh_ : this script will send you an email containing the public IP of the device on which it is run. Very useful if you have a server home (or a simple device as a raspberry pi), and don't want to suscribe to a no-ip service. Installation is very simple : adds a cron rule. This interesting thing in this script is that it will send you an email *only* if your address has changed.

# Configs

   * _apache_webdav_cors.conf_ and _nginx_webdav_cors.conf_ : config files for apache and nginx respectively, which allow to use CORS on webdav shares. They could be improved by using a variable saving the referer name, to allow CORS on every domain, and not only one specific hardcoded one.
   * etc_network_interfaces and wpa_supplicant.conf : allow a device to connect to a WEP Wifi network on boot. Used for my raspberry pi. The config to connect to a WPA network is easy to find, but it isn't for a WEP network.
